- Scweet requires selenium-4.2.0 to run properly.
- Scweet-Modified comments out some print statements in the original package. 
- Since Scweet-Modifed is integrated as part of the source code, it is not listed in requirement.txt

To install requirements for the external packages used (sgnlp and scweet-modified_ver), run:
<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
